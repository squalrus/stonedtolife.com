Happy August!? The summer sure has flown by.

I'm glad you found this site. I've been excited to share this and particularly to start the "[take what you need" project](https://stonedtolife.com/take-what-you-need/).Â Except COVID had other plans. My entire family contracted COVID and of course it had to be during the hottest part of the summer so far. We managed, barely. Our lives, and health, are returning to more of a balance and so I can launch this site finally.

Thank you for visiting. Visit often please and let me know your thoughts and ideas. [I'd love to hear from you](https://stonedtolife.com/contact/).

Thank you,

Renee
