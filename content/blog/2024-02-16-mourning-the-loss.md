M﻿y last surviving grandmother passed away on 2/9 at the age of 90 years young. Her death was anticipated, though the decline was rapid. She is missed by many and cannot be replaced. I had a visit home to Wisconsin planned for 1.5 weeks later. Now instead of flying home for family visits I'll be flying home for a funeral. 

When my grandfather passed away in 2021 I was unable to attend the funeral in Wisconsin because of COVID. To assist in my grieving, and as a way to be with family from afar, I painted several rocks commemorating my grandfather. I mailed them to the pastor and they were available to funeral attendees. This time I can attend the funeral, though my aunts, uncles, and cousins so appreciated the rocks they asked me to do them again for my grandmother. I am glad to be able to support my family in this way.
