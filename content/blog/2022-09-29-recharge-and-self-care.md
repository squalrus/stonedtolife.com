Take a stroll or ride on over to Fremont Ave N and N. 80th Street for a unique self-care and exploration opportunity. Peruse the available rocks and choose one to take home that speaks to your current mood. Rocks change frequently so visit often. Don't see a rock that fits, just [let me know](https://stonedtolife.com/contact/) what you'd like to see.
