So a few weeks ago I refreshed the "take what you need" display. Shortly after I discovered that overnight several of the rocks had gone missing, as well as the label rock "take what you need." One painted rock was left: "understanding." Seems too convenient to me but like it could also be a message. No sweat. The project will go on, eventually.
