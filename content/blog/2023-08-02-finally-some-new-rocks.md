L﻿ife has slowed down just enough for me to find time for painting. Or it's gotten too crazy that I forced time for myself to craft. Either way, new rocks are ready for you to enjoy :) \
\
F﻿or about the last year my kids and I have collected rocks shaped like hearts. I've painted a heart on each one to bring out the true wonder of the rock. I hope they bring you some joy as well. 

A﻿nd finally the "take what you need" rocks have made a comeback! I hope you visit the display soon and find some of what you need. Rocks should switch frequently so visit often. 

A﻿nd please remember to [report your rock sightings](https://stonedtolife.com/report-a-rock-finding/) and/or [contact me](https://stonedtolife.com/contact/) to suggest new ideas for painted rocks. 

H﻿ope you have a great day.
