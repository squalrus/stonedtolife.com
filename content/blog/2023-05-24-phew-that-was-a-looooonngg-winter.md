Sï»¿pring in Seattle is strange. Wait, is it even Spring? The weather lately has been so up and down. I finally got back into some rock painting but so far it has only been to label plants in my garden. But at least the paints are out of hibernation!   Meanwhile, until I can produce some worthy rocks please enjoy searching the neighborhood for a few gems created by my children. Remember to [report your rock sighting ](https://stonedtolife.com/report-a-rock-finding/)and take it home to treasure it, or hide it again for a lovely surprise for the next passerby. Happy Spring and happy rock hunting.
