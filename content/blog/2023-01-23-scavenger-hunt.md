Wï»¿e are lucky that our kindergartner can walk to and from their school, however, it entails a significant hill. Lately the walk up the hill after school has taken longer and longer. I devised a plan for a scavenger hunt and will trial it today. Hopefully these rainbow rocks will encourage a little pep in their step :)
