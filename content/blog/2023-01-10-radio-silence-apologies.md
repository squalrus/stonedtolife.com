Hello fellow rock lovers. I apologize for my silence and inactivity as of late. The "take what you need rocks" have taken an unexpected and longer than hoped hiatus. I've got the hankering to start crafting again, now I just need to find the time. Keep in touch with news of rocks you find in the mean time and stay tuned to this page for updates on new rocks hopefully coming soon.
