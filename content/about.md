Renee is a stay at home parent in Seattle's Greenwood neighborhood. 

On far too many neighborhood walks, Renee and her family began to notice colorful rocks scattered about. The strange rocks brought joy, consistency, mystery, and later on, purpose. 

What started as a kids' art project to kill time during the COVID-19 pandemic quickly morphed into a fulfilling hobby for Renee. Now Renee uses the combination of found rocks and paint to tell stories, express feelings, and spread joy and curiosity. 

The rocks have introduced excitement and drama (but only the positive kind) and we hope you find the same.
